/* Task description:
Write a program to store the parameters of a circle on a 2D plane:
the x and y coordinates of the center point and r, the radius.
All three parameters are real (floating point) numbers.

    >Define a type to store the parameters of a circle.
    >Write a function that receives the parameters of two circles as function parameters,
    and returns whether the two circles overlap or not. (Two circles overlap if the distance between their center points
    - computed by the Pythagorean theorem - is less than the sum of their radius.)
    >Write a function that asks the user to enter the parameters of a circle, creates the circle, and returns it.
    >Expand the type definition and the functions to a program that reads the data of two circles,
    decides if they overlap, and displays a message accordingly.
